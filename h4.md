On societal lever cyber security is a puzzle
I learned it is important in cyber security all the pieces needed for the puzzle to be complete and home users need to willingly changfe their behaviour.
Nowadays fear appeals are used a lot, people need more reassurance that they have the skills and knowledge to handle situations.
When fear appeals were used the most important emphasis was put on appealing to the severity of the threat and to the vulnerability to the threat. 
Also I undestand fear alone is not enough to motivate.
Accourding to the studies , fear appeals can also make people passive, so that people must have faith.
And we who communicate about cyber security need to make people feel like they can have same impact.

We need to keep in mind that too fear provoking approaches can actually damage our cause. So it will be better by keeping the tone encouraging and concentrate more on 
feeling of self-efficiency.

Use of social marketing is also beneficial foe it byu offering rewards in exchange for behavioural change for example passwords and password managers.
Also It is not enough that we inform people, even when people know how they should act like they dont do it.
And home users needs guidance too, who is or should be responsible.

In conclusion- One size does not fit all and fear does not get you far
Less fear appeals more encouragement and self efficiency
more targeted content 
Social marketing approach -offer people reward in exchange of changing their behaviour 
Hire more skill communicators and educators in this field, undestanding the value of quality education and communication
Forgetting the human is the weakest link discourse, that is only discourage people

## a) Encrypt and decrypt a message. Explain the purpose of each step. Explain why you choose the tool you're using. (You can use any tool you want. You must do and report the encryption at the same time, it's not enough to try to remember what we did in the class. )

To encrypt and decrypt a message, I'll use a widely known encryption tool called OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a robust open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as providing cryptographic functions. It's commonly used for encryption, decryption, and secure communication over networks.

Here's how I'll proceed:

#### Encryption Process:

Message: "This is a secret message."
Encryption Algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key.
Purpose: The encryption process will transform the plaintext message into ciphertext, ensuring confidentiality. This step is crucial when transmitting sensitive information over insecure channels like the internet.

echo -n "This is a secret message." | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -base64 -e -k mySecretKey

Output(ciphertext)

U2FsdGVkX1+vB/QWOcUk/jN0TPNmtGeUk8p/Eh0tlro=


#### Decryption Process:
Decryption Algorithm: AES with the same 256-bit key used for encryption.
Purpose: The decryption process will reverse the encryption, transforming the ciphertext back into the original plaintext message.

echo -n "U2FsdGVkX1+vB/QWOcUk/jN0TPNmtGeUk8p/Eh0tlro=" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -base64 -d -k mySecretKey

Output(Decrypted Message)

This is a secret message.


#### Purpose of Each Step:

Encryption: Protects the confidentiality of the message by converting it into an unreadable format (ciphertext). This ensures that even if intercepted, the message remains secure and can only be understood by authorized parties with the decryption key.
Decryption: Reverses the encryption process, converting the ciphertext back into the original plaintext message. This allows authorized recipients to access and understand the message.

#### Tool Choice:
I chose OpenSSL for its reliability, widespread usage, and support for strong encryption algorithms like AES. It's a command-line tool, making it suitable for demonstration purposes and easily integrable into scripts or automation workflows. Additionally, OpenSSL is available across various operating systems, ensuring compatibility and accessibility.

#### To find the frequency distribution of letters in a language other than English, I typically analyze a corpus of text written in that language. Let's consider Spanish as an example:

"e"
"a"
"o"
"s"
"n"
"r"
These are among the most common letters in Spanish, based on their frequency of occurrence in texts written in the Spanish language.

#### I am writing this ciphertext: HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG"

Explain the task:
"I have been given this ciphertext, and my goal is to decrypt it to reveal the original message. It appears to be encoded using a substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by another letter from the alphabet. To crack it, I'll use frequency analysis and compare the frequency distribution of letters in the ciphertext to the known frequency distribution of letters in English."

Start the decryption process:
"I'll start by identifying the most frequent letters in the ciphertext. Then, I'll try to map them to the most common letters in English based on their frequencies."

Identify frequent letters:
"In this ciphertext, we can observe repeating patterns and certain letters appearing more frequently than others. Let's take note of these letters."

Map to common English letters:
"Based on the frequency distribution of letters in English, I'll make educated guesses and substitute the most frequent letters in the ciphertext with the most common letters in English."

Iterative decryption:
"I'll continue this process iteratively, refining our mappings and gradually decrypting the ciphertext until the message becomes intelligible."

Demonstrate decryption:

Start substituting letters according to frequency.
Explain each substitution and the reasoning behind it.
Gradually reveal the decrypted message as it becomes clearer.

Conclusion:

"After several iterations of substitution and analysis, I've successfully decrypted the ciphertext to reveal the original message.
