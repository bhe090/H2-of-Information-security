## Threat Modeling Manifesto

 The Threat Modeling Manifesto outlines is a methodology for analyzing system representations to identify security and privacy concerns. It centers around four key questions: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job? The goal is to recognize vulnerabilities early and continuously improve system security throughout its lifecycle. The manifesto encourages everyone concerned about privacy and security to engage in threat modeling and serves as a flexible guide for developing or refining methodologies. It adopts values and principles akin to the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing prioritization and providing guidelines for effective threat modeling practices. Ultimately, the manifesto aims to enhance the development of secure applications, systems, and organizations.

What I understand after viewing this threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and addressing potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system or application. It involves asking key questions about what is being built, what could go wrong, how to mitigate risks, and assessing the effectiveness of security measures. Threat modeling helps teams proactively design and implement security controls, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture of a system throughout its development lifecycle.

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) play a crucial role in threat modeling by visually representing how data moves through a system. They help identify data sources, sinks, and flows, define system boundaries, and facilitate the identification of potential security threats and vulnerabilities. DFDs assist in asset identification, impact analysis, and overall understanding of the system's data flow, contributing to the proactive design of security controls during threat modeling.

- What can go wrong in Threat modeling
Incomplete Scope: Missing threats due to not considering all system components.

- Lack of Expertise: Overlooking threats if the team lacks security knowledge.

- Failure to Update: Outdated threat models due to neglecting regular reviews.

- Assumption Errors: Incorrect assumptions about security properties can lead to oversight.

- Ignoring Human Factors: Neglecting human-related threats like social engineering.

- Poor Communication: Misunderstandings about identified threats due to ineffective communication.

- Overemphasis on Specific Threats: Focusing too much on known threats and neglecting emerging ones.

- Not Prioritizing Threats: Inadequate resource allocation due to failure to prioritize threats.

- Overcomplicating the Process: Discouraging participation with an overly complex threat modeling process.

- Inadequate Documentation: Poor documentation hinders knowledge transfer and future updates.


In the context of threat modeling, risk management plays a vital role. The process begins with the identification of potential threats and vulnerabilities within a system or application. Following this, a thorough assessment is conducted to determine the severity and likelihood of each identified threat. Prioritization is then key, focusing efforts on mitigating the most critical risks based on their potential impact. Mitigation strategies are developed to address these threats, and resource allocation is determined in alignment with the priority of risks. Continuous monitoring ensures the effectiveness of implemented measures, with adjustments made as needed. Clear communication of identified risks and mitigation plans is essential, supported by comprehensive documentation. The adaptability of threat models to changing circumstances and a feedback loop for ongoing improvement complete the integration of risk management into the threat modeling process.

Also STRIDE is a mnemonic that represents a framework for identifying different types of security threats in threat modeling. It stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. Each element of STRIDE represents a category of potential threats that could impact the security of a system. Incorporating STRIDE into threat modeling helps teams systematically analyze and address security risks, enhancing the overall resilience of a system or application.

#### Chapter 1Dive In and Threat Model!
- It is showing that anyone can and should learn threat modeling, a practical discipline for identifying security issues. It involves using abstract models to see the bigger picture beyond code specifics, aiming to catch problems before implementation. The chapter promotes a hands-on, experience-based approach, likening it to learning to play an instrument, where practice leads to improvement. By providing a simple four-step breakdown, the passage encourages readers to develop their threat modeling skills through practical application rather than theoretical knowledge.

#### Threat Modeling cheat sheet
- The Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet serves as a concise reference for both beginners and those seeking a refresher on threat modeling. Emphasizing its importance for modern application developers, the cheatsheet outlines threat modeling as a structured process to understand and address security issues in a system. It advocates for early integration into the software development life cycle (SDLC) and highlights the four key questions it should answer: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job? The advantages of threat modeling include improved system visibility, increased security awareness, and early risk identification. The process involves application decomposition, threat identification and ranking using techniques like STRIDE, response and mitigations, and a final review by all stakeholders. The cheatsheet concludes with references to additional resources and various threat modeling methods.

### Advantage 

- The Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet outlines several advantages of incorporating threat modeling into the development process. These advantages include:

- Improved Visibility of Target of Evaluation (TOE): Threat modeling requires a deep understanding of the system, leading to improved visibility into its interactions, data flows, and trust boundaries.

- Increased Security Awareness: Threat modeling encourages creative and critical thinking about security landscapes, fostering a "think like an attacker" mindset. It's a team effort that enhances security knowledge through idea sharing and feedback.

- Identify Risks Early-On: By performing threat modeling during the design phase, potential security issues are identified early, allowing for the integration of security measures into the system development rather than applying them as an afterthought.

#### Thread Identification and ranking:
 After identifying potential threats and understanding the system, the next step in threat modeling involves determining responses and mitigations. These responses, as outlined by Adam Shostack, include mitigation, elimination, transfer, or acceptance of the identified risks. Mitigation strategies, when chosen, must be practical and actionable, addressing either specific threats or entire threat categories. Documentation of these responses is crucial, and resources like OWASP's ASVS and MITRE's CWE list can aid in formulating effective mitigation plans. Following this, the threat model undergoes a comprehensive review involving all stakeholders, not just development or security teams. The focus includes ensuring the accuracy of system representations, identification of all threats, agreement on response strategies, development of mitigation plans for relevant threats, formal documentation, and storage of artifacts. Additionally, the ability to test agreed-upon mitigations and measure the success or failure of the threat model's requirements and recommendations is crucial for an effective and thorough threat modeling process.
